Interviews at tech companies are always some of the most unique experiences. When my roommate and I would get ready together the difference between East Coast corporations and West Coast tech companies today was ever clear. She would come out of her room fully clad in a suit and heels. Of course, that has been the expectation for interviews for the longest time. Every candidate, no matter the job, no matter the industry, was expected to dress professionally. From the minute you walked into an interview room, you were judged from head to toe. Any out of place hair was an immediate indicator to the employer that you didn't care enough to be perfect or weren't good enough to work at XYZ Inc. 

The tech industry attire was definitely a shock for me the first time. I walked into my first interview dressed completely professionally as I had been instructed by my parents and all my friends. To my surprise, my interviewer was wearing a T-shirt, jeans and sandals. I almost thought I had walked into the wrong room. I quickly learned that the general attire for software engineers is merely whatever is comfortable to them. What my interviewer was wearing told me so much about the company culture, the work environment, and the people who worked at the company itself.

I had always gone to my parents for professional advice. My dad has worked at various automotive companies in Detroit and my mom has been working as a DBA for years. They both seemed to understand the ups and downs of interviewing and getting a job they wanted. This was the first time that their advice didn't seem to fit. Not only is there a difference between the mentality of tech companies and traditional corporations; there is also similar differences between many East Coast and West Coast companies. 

I had never really understood why everyone HAD to dress up for work everyday except for "casual fridays". Finally I had found an industry that understood my thoughts on work attire. I don't know if everyone feels the same, but I believe that you work best when you're comfortable and in an environment most suitable to your work ethic. I would personally never be able to get lots of work done dressed in business formals every day.

The ideal behind casual work attire and fun, exciting offices is to encourage creativity. As James Burke of Acrylicize stated in an <a href="http://venturevillage.eu/art-workplace-design-startup-culture">article with Venture Village</a>, “People spend so much time at work and I think it’s important to have an environment that is inducive to being inspired and alert – why can’t a space be enlightening and inspiring?” If employees are comfortable and creative in itself, then they are bound to be more creative in their work and enjoy work more.
