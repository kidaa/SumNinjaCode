Interviews at tech companies are always some of the most unique experiences. When my roommate and I would get ready together the difference between East Coast corporations and West Coast tech companies today was ever clear. She would come out of her room fully clad in a suit and heels. Of course, that has been the expectation for interviews for the longest time. Every candidate, no matter the job, no matter the industry, was expected to dress professionally. From the minute you walked into an interview room, you were judged from head to toe. Any out of place hair was an immediate indicator to the employer that you didn't care enough to be perfect or not ---- enough to work at XYZ Inc. 

The tech industry attire was definitely a shock for me the first time. I walked into my first interview dressed completely professionally as I had been instructed by my parents and all my friends. To my surprise, my interviewer was wearing a T-shirt, jeans and sandals. I almost thought I had walked into the wrong room. I quickly learned that the general attire for software engineers is merely whatever is comfortable to them.
